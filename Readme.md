##  Code Quality Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- **Static Classes**: Organized problem-solving utilities
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive method and variable names
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each problem in its own dedicated file
- **Modular Design**: Independent, reusable problem solutions

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling with `TryParse`
- **User Experience**: Clear prompts and formatted output
- **Code Organization**: Logical file structure and naming conventions
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms (O(√n) for prime checking)
- **Modern C# Features**: Nullable reference types, implicit usings, string interpolation

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Programs continue execution despite invalid input
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error descriptions and retry guidance
- **Edge Case Handling**: Comprehensive boundary condition testing
