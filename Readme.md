##  Technology Stack

- **C# 12** - Modern .NET with latest language features
- **.NET 10.0** - Latest framework with enhanced performance
- **Visual Studio 2022+** - Professional development environment
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
- **Nullable Reference Types** - Modern C# safety features
- **Implicit Usings** - Clean code practices

---


##  Learning Progression
###  Level 01 - Class and Objects
Object-oriented fundamentals: classes, objects, methods, and properties
- Creating classes and instantiating objects
- Defining fields, properties, constructors, and methods
- Encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private)
- Object interaction and method invocation

---

##  Code Quality Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- **Static Classes**: Organized problem-solving utilities
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive method and variable names
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each problem in its own dedicated file
- **Modular Design**: Independent, reusable problem solutions

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling with `TryParse`
- **User Experience**: Clear prompts and formatted output
- **Code Organization**: Logical file structure and naming conventions
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms (O(√n) for prime checking)
- **Modern C# Features**: Nullable reference types, implicit usings, string interpolation

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Programs continue execution despite invalid input
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error descriptions and retry guidance
- **Edge Case Handling**: Comprehensive boundary condition testing

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **.NET 10.0 SDK** 
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **Visual Studio Code** with C# extension
- **Git** for version control

### Running the Programs

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CoreProgramming
   ```

2. **Navigate to any Branch**:
   ```bash
   git switch branch-name
   ```

3. **Run a specific level**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
