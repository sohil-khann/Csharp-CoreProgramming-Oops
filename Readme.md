##  Learning Progression

###  Level 01 - Class and Objects
Object-oriented fundamentals: classes, objects, methods, and properties.
- **Bank Account System**: Implementation of static variables, readonly fields, and \is\ operator for instance validation.
- **Library Management**: Demonstrates static methods, \	his\ keyword for constructor initialization, and readonly properties.
- **Employee Management**: Focuses on object initialization, static counters for tracking instances, and member access.
- **Shopping Cart**: Seasonal discount management using static members and method updates.
- **Student Management**: Academic record tracking with readonly roll numbers and university-wide static data.
- **Vehicle Registration**: Fee management and vehicle identification using OOP principles.
- **Hospital Management**: Patient record tracking with unique identifiers and hospital-wide configurations.

##  Code Quality Standards

### Architecture Patterns
- **Static Classes**: Organized problem-solving utilities
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive method and variable names
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each problem in its own dedicated file
- **Modular Design**: Independent, reusable problem solutions

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling with \TryParse\ and manual parsing.
- **User Experience**: Clear prompts and formatted output for console applications.
- **Code Organization**: Logical file structure and naming conventions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient use of static members for shared data.
- **Modern C# Features**: Nullable reference types, implicit usings, string interpolation, and \is\ pattern matching.

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Programs continue execution despite invalid input.
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error descriptions and retry guidance.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Comprehensive boundary condition testing for user inputs.
